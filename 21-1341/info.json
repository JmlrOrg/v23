    "abstract": "This paper focuses on learning rate analysis of Nystrom regularization with sequential sub-sampling for $\\tau$-mixing time series. Using a recently developed Banach-valued Bernstein inequality for $\\tau$-mixing sequences and an integral operator approach based on second-order decomposition, we succeed in deriving almost optimal learning rates of Nystrom regularization with sequential sub-sampling for $\\tau$-mixing time series. A series of numerical experiments are carried out to verify our theoretical results, showing the  excellent learning performance of Nystrom regularization with sequential sub-sampling in learning massive  time series data. All these results extend the applicable range of  Nystr\\\"{o}m regularization  from i.i.d. samples to non-i.i.d. sequences.",
