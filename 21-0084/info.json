    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the graph-based approach to semi-supervised learning under a manifold assumption. We adopt a Bayesian perspective and demonstrate that, for a suitable choice of prior constructed with sufficiently many unlabeled data, the posterior contracts around the truth at a rate that is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Our theory covers both regression and classification.",
