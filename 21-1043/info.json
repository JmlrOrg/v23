    "abstract": "We present a universally consistent learning rule whose expected error is monotone non-increasing with the sample size under every data distribution. The question of existence of such rules was brought up in 1996 by Devroye, Gy\u00f6rfi and Lugosi (who called them ``smart''). Our rule is fully deterministic, a data-dependent partitioning rule constructed in an arbitrary domain (a standard Borel space) using a cyclic order. The central idea is to only partition at each step those cyclic intervals that exhibit a sufficient empirical diversity of labels, thus avoiding a region where the error function is convex.",
