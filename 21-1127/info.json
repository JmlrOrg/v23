    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Tianshou, a highly modularized Python library for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that uses PyTorch as its backend. Tianshou intends to be research-friendly by providing a flexible and reliable infrastructure of DRL algorithms. It supports online and offline training with more than 20 classic algorithms through a unified interface. To facilitate related research and prove Tianshou's reliability, we have released Tianshou's benchmark of MuJoCo environments, covering eight classic algorithms with state-of-the-art performance. We open-sourced Tianshou at https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/.",
