    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for clustering using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the Max k-Cut problem.  The approach is based on a new methodology for rounding the solution of an SDP relaxation using iterated linear optimization.  We show the vertices of the Max k-Cut relaxation correspond to partitions of the data into at most k sets.  We also show the vertices are attractive fixed points of iterated linear optimization.  Each step of this iterative process solves a relaxation of the closest vertex problem and leads to a new clustering problem where the underlying clusters are more clearly defined.  Our experiments show that using fixed point iteration for rounding the Max k-Cut SDP relaxation leads to significantly better results when compared to randomized rounding.",
