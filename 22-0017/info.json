    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce d3rlpy, an open-sourced offline deep reinforcement learning (RL) library for Python. d3rlpy supports a set of offline deep RL algorithms as well as off-policy online algorithms via a fully documented plug-and-play API. To address a reproducibility issue, we conduct a large-scale benchmark with D4RL and Atari 2600 dataset to ensure implementation quality and provide experimental scripts and full tables of results. The d3rlpy source code can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy.",
